# RABO

A csv bank statement converter, created for the RaboBank in javascript.
Drag a csv file in the dropbox of the site and it will prompt for a download of the converted file.

The system will split unique account numbers in different output files.

Everything is done locally.

## Just let me use it!
The latest version of the master branch can be used at [GitHub Pages](https://danielswrath.github.io/RABO).
