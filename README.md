# YNAB Going Dutch

A CSV bank statement converter, created for Dutch banks. Completely written in javascript.
Select csv files using the `Browse` button and it will download the converted file, super quick and easy! (Firefox will give you a prompt first. Chrome will ask you for permission if multiple files are downloaded)

The system will split unique account numbers in different output files.

Everything is done locally. Your information never leaves your own computer.
